	Arthur Sameul: field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
	algorithms that play checkers, Computer plays better than Arthur himself
	
	Tom Mitchell: experience E, task T, performance measure P
	
4 Major Sections
	1. Supervised Learning
		a. regression, classification (SVM can even handle feature space with infinite dimensions!), etc.
	2. Learning Theory
		a. why learning algorithms work
		b. how to apply them effectively
		c. how many data do you need
	3. Unsupervised Learning
		a. find interesting structures in the data
		b. clustering, image processing (grouping pixels â†’ 3D model from a single image), Independent Component Analysis
		c. organizing computer clusters, social network analysis, market segmentation, EEG data, text analysis etc.
	4. Enforcement Learning
