**Failed at something:**
	During the second year of my graduate program at GWU, I joined a local non-profit organization in Washington, D.C. to rejuvonate Chinatown region by holding monthly meetup events. 
	Goal: to establish a supporting group by holding community events, pschological counseling sessions
	My task: recruit and train volunteers
	Problem: there was no enough manpower, no consistent and persistent training → no devoted volunteers
	Action: tried my way for two months
	
**Customer-Centric:**
	Inforce Line Count Summary Report for Major Account executives
		Situation: they need a succinct summary of the inforce business under their accounts, line count is the key, better to be dynamic, no
					power pivot, want have the ability to toggle accross different regions, owners...
		Solution:
			designed logic to add dummy rows & columns to keep the pivot table with constant shape
			designed a template and fined a parter (Chris Harris) from the customer group; interact with him weekly (asked for approval and suggestions)
			"Faked" the distinct count functionality by creating dummy variable and removing "duplicates"
			Ensured the dummy column was arranged to the far right so that user won't easily find it and thus causing confusion when drilling down to policy level details
			Added slicer to toggle all pivots together, and hidded the slicer
			Added macros that creates a new sheet of same content and format, so that users can do customized sorting
			Added print buttons to print the current page and the entire 

**Own my dependency:**
	Eliminate the phase of IT help on creating the customized D&B Tree, Taking over my dependency


**Invent & Simplify / Customer-Centric**
	 e.g. Improved the process of data retrieval for my manager
		select from Netezza, copy and paste into Excel, do pivot tables on it, need more rows/columns, recreate pivot tables, .....
		ODBC to Excel Table, create tables for project, Add macros and Buttons to update the "connection sql statement" so he just need to input new table name, self-service data-retrieval tool
	
	e.g. Simplify the D&B data quality correction process
		let each account owner enter the missing policies to his/her account
			sharepoint site form
			enter policy_no & account_name
			load their inputs into a table, check conflicts
				if no, make up in our reporting database
				if yes, generate an email for the two competing account owners with a pre-written template
				
**Deep Dive** 
	e.g. I was tasked to handle the Data Quality Issue of Major Account Reporting
			why do the policies roll up to accounts incorrectly?  — Incorrect Account DUNS, Incorrect Policy DUNS
			why are DUNS incorrect? — legacy data issue, incorrect
			why incorrect? — no validation procedure
			why can't this be changed? 
				— Operations Team are out of capacity; 
				— Business Unit don't care about DUNS data quality; 
				— Tracker was not designed to do reporting; 
				— Tracker DBA is reluctant to update production data;
			What should I do? 
				— get the support from senior management, source of bad data → each underwriter
				— manually line up policy_no to account_id
			Wrote 2 long emails to my manager, analyzing the root cause of this issue, different players, why do we stuck, what should we do.....
