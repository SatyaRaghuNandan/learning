====== technical interviews ======
Created Tuesday 25 April 2017

**Whiteboarding:**

	The best answer is the solution that the interviewer thinks is the best
	
	Interviewee:
		Ask how many questions are there and how much time do you get
		Remove the ambiguities by asking the interviewer
		Discuss high-level approach before starting writing code
		Explain why you are doing the way you are doing
		Enunciate what you think along the way
	
	Interviewer:
		Don't go against the interviewer
		Pick their head for what they know
		Poke them gently in the right direction if she/he get really lost
		
	Do paired Mock Interviews!!! 4-5 times a week to start to have fun and pick up momentum!
	Work on personal projects!!!
	Practice for the sake of practice, not just for a particular interview!!! Part of your life now.
	Keep applying, keep practicing and keep interviewing
	


**Technical questions:**
	Interviewer wants to learn about you:
	1. how do you approach a problem
	2. able to defend your answers?
	3. can communicate well?
	4. be able to pause and check your thought process
	5. demonstrate your sense, strength, weakness (honesty)

	ask how much time do I have for this question? how deep should I go?
	always clarify the questions and know how you will be evaluated
		do you like quick solution? high-quality solution? many solutions? my best solution only?

	when you stuck, talk it though creatively, why you are stuck and ask for help, "am I on the right track?"
	"I have seen a similar problem"
	"This is a very interesting problem. Sorry I can't solve it now. I am not a quick person. I will go back and send you my answer. Do you mind that?"

	Be prepared to answer hard questions:
	1. are you sure your answer is right?
	2. can you solve the question in a different way?
	3. which solution is the best?

Always ask for feedbacks (this might be the only hour in my life talking to you, can you tell me how I can improve?)
provide follow-ups
	"I really enjoyed the conersation with you. Can I have your email address?"
	In follow-up Email:
		what you taught me
		what I didn't do well but realized now
		"I'd like to hear your feedback"
	
When preparing inerview quesions, practice talking it out loud (just getting the right answer is not enough... talk the thought process out!)
