Bad Job Interview: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkSfp3XHSko

Don't turn down an interview, even for the sake of practice

handshakes:
super-hawk, limb-fish

low-register and soothing voice

talking points (after GA experience):
	1. learn new techs quicly and apply them quickly
	2. work in an agile env
	3. multiple projects
	4. work in teams as wells as indicidually, and meet deadlines
	5. ask the right questions and get the right answers (Labs & Project with vague directions and you figured them out!!!)

questions to ask:
	1. where is your team strongest?
	2. where is your team weakest?
	3. how many ppl on ur team?
	4. how many data scientists do you plan to have in 3 months?
	5. Is this a role you are creating/to be backfilled? Somebody left?
	6. What's the career trajectory of people work here? Do they view it as a spring-board?
	7. **What are the biggest challenges for this position? (the interviewer will automatically think and tell you about the last person at this role) Don't ask about the last person directly**

Question to ask at the end:
	1. What are the next steps in the process?
	2. Who should I follow up with? (Get a specific name, email/phone)
