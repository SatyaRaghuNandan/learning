14 leadership principles: 


In general: encourages every employee to act & think like leaders 

When something failed, just ask "Here's what didn't work, why it didn't work, and how we're going to change." 

No matter what job you do, always improve on the processes in ways that ultimately enhance the customer experience and/or lower the cost.  

**Dive Deep** 
no PowerPoint, only essays that forces you to think deeply & thoroughly about your process 

**Invent and Simplify** (links to Think Big, because simple designs SCALEs much better than complex ones) 

Simple is beautiful; Your design better to be simple, scalable, elastic (scale up, scale down), self-service is the future, provide platform service; capabilities are designed from the user backwards with algorithms, automation, workflow and technology; 
To scale and improve your business, you need well-defined Process; But avoid Bureaucracy is essential! 
Leverage on other people's work: Amazon Mechanical Turk (small yet essential and practically endless tasks 
Leverage on competitor's work: Amazon Auction, Ebay, Amazon Third-Party Selling 

**Take ownership of Results:** 
Never say "That's not my job". You act on behalf of the entire company, not just your own team. 
Be ready to speak up and contribute without having to be asked. 
You Own Your Dependencies: identify and tenaciously manage every potential business-derailing dependency you have (SLA, rock-solid contracts, penalties in place, continual & active management of communication):

	whenever  possible, take over the dependencies 
	if impossible, negotiate  & manage unambiguous and clear commitments from others 
	Create hedges wherever possible, a fallback plan 
	
Amazon is a company run by Control Freaks 


**Customer Obsession:**  
客户有什么要求，你如何让客户满意: 

**Insist on the highest standards** 
SLA: service level agreement is a contract that specifies the precise standards to which a particular service will be held. (inputs, outputs, metrics to define acceptable quality and performance) 

Jeff expects all people to function as both leader & owner 

Amazon is a huge company that runs like a start-up: you are required to do excellent work at a frenetic, breakneck pace while still adhering to time-consuming processes:  

 
**Have a Bias for Action** ( team is like a start-up; leaned new skills C++, Python, Actuarial Exams; Example of Geo Map of Major Accounts before the Kick-Off meeting on Christmas Eve) 

always move forward on things without waiting to be asked to do so; acute, contemplative yet avoids the paralysis from analysis  

There are continuous pressure to get things done as quickly as possible 

It encourages decision-making based on gut instinct 

You balance the bias for action with the ability to be right a lot BY developing & monitoring the metrics!! 

Amazon awards system recognizes people who develop new skills or attributes 

快速有效地做工作，不要太拖拉 

 

**Earn the Trust of Others** 

	admit your own failures, showing your humility but not being exploitable; don't build a wall around yourself 

	when bad thing happens, don't do finger-pointing; take the blame even it's not directly your fault 

	praise your team members in front their peers and superiors 

	don't micro-manage, let your team members to explore new ideas & be creative 

	accept confrontation, don't falsely agree, there should always be disagreements 

	find the value (strength) in each person 

Amazon has small 8-10 Two-Pizza Teams, operates independently and with agility; autonomous; it works because of the trust among Amazon people 

完成自己的任务先，得到别人的信任 

 

**Think Big:** 

Amazon's secret sauces -- to think about the vast potential of a project from day one and create an inspired team that owns that 

Free Cash Flow -- primary ingredient for investment in innovation 

The Regret Minimization Framework --  

"I wanted to project myself to age 80 and say, 'Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have. I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this."  

创新的看法, it's an important principle for your promotion
