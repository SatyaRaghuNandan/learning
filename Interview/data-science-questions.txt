Created Sunday 12 February 2017

1. **What's your process to handle a problem as a DS?**
		1. Business Understanding
			a. understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective
			b. converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition
			c. design a preliminary plan
		2. Data Understand
		
			In Steps 1-2 I need to ask:
				What's the problem? 
				Where is the data? 
				Who is the subject-matter expert?
		
	3. Data Preparation
	
	4. Modeling
	5. Evaluation
	6. Deployment

2. **How do you store large amout of data like 2 million rows with 150 attributes?**
		If it requires real-time access, quick storage: use Mongo or Spark
	
3. **How do you handle Missing Values in the features column AND target variable?**
		Imputation:
			Imputer Package from SK_Learn: Mean, Median, Most Frequent
				Create Inclusion Indicator for the problematic column, Check its correlation with other columns:
	1. missing at completely random, **filling with Mean and Median?** 
	2. missing at random, with some patterns
		a. treat inclusion indicator as target variable, use Logistic Regression to predict it with other columns
		b. If a reasonable accuracy score, we say there are good correlations
		c. then predict that column with values from other columns (linear regresion etc.)
		d. **WHY can we do this?**
	3. missing not at random (pattern): collect more data or irgnore that column
		Resampling:
		
		to check:
			is that feature important?
			if it's necessary to include in the model:
				how many rows are missing?
				Can you predict it with high confidence?
			Is it a numerical or categorical (year) feature?
What pattern is it missing?

		 
4. **How do you do feature enginerring?**
5. **How would you use existing features to add new features?**
		......
	
5. **What are the major classification algorithms and what are the pros and cons of them?**
		why is Naive Bayes classifier usually less accurate than linear models?
	
6. **How would you handle large real-time analysis problem, what tool?**
		Spark

7. **Tell me about your experience with Machine Learning?**
		dfdfdfd

8. Tell me about an ML algorithm
