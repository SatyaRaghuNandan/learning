AA is the language used to describe the high-level performance of computer algorithms.
	supress constant factors (system/architecture dependent) and lower-order terms (irrelevant for  large inputs)
			e.g. 6N * (log N + 1) is just N*logN, written as O(N*logN)
			**Question: why exactly can we drop the Constant Factor 6 here?** 
	
	Further work: improve the Leading Constant Factor or the Lower-Order Terms also


Definition:
	T(n) : Run time given input size of n
	T(n) = O [ f(n) ] if eventually (for all sufficiently large n), T(n) is bounded above by a constant multiples of f(n)
