====== To Do ======
Created Wednesday 21 December 2016

To Do's:
	1. better graphs, legends, labels for Project, **why sometimes results in Negative Classifier?**
	2. QQ's tips:
		Neal analytics works very closely with azure ML. So it would be better to get yourself familiarized a bit before talking to them. I have played with azure ML before. Very easy. Look at their demos. It won't take more than two hours.
		Worst case, if none of you heard back from those companies after some time, let me know. I can try to find the contacts.
	5. use GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/) as my **portfolio** (use HTML to edit the templates) got from
		start bootstrap https://startbootstrap.com/ (remember to copy contents in the folder, not the folder)  or 
		Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/)
			    
		create one github page per project (new repos, use orphan branches, use templates that's consistent with the Main page one)

	6. Practice the FOUNDAMENTALs!      SQL, General-Purpose Coding, ML algorithms
	7. Apply and Reseach Amazon SCOT jobs (https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/supply-chain-optimization-technologies?base_query=&loc_query=&job_count=100&result_limit=20&sort=recent&team_category%5B%5D=supply-chain-optimization-technologies&location%5B%5D=seattle-wa&cache)
