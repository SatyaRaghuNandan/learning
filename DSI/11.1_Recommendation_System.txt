====== 11.1 Recommendation System ======
Created Monday 12 December 2016

A ranking or prediction is produced to proivde personalized recommendations to users

1. type of data
	User Log: access logs, session lengths (sessions are separated by 30 min inactivity), click/non-clicks, time spent on a page, purhase history, product description
	Review: ratings, upvotes, weighted scale, grades, relevance feedback
	etc.
	
2. implicit vs. explicit
	a. wifi logs at Target (implicit)
	b. amazon reviews (explicit)
	c. user engagement metrics (implicit)  e.g. page view per user

3. LCA (legal compliance agreement?)
4. Example: Netflix movie recommendation, Matrix Factorization (user matrix - N*d, item matrix - l*M, relationship matrix - d*l between user and item features, final product is a matrix of N*d * d*l * l*M = N*M)

6. Content-based filtering (based on the contents you viewed in the past; e.g. Amazon books recom for YOU, Netflix move recommendation)
7. Difficulties for Content-Based Filtering (must map items into a feature space, recoms are limited in scope (need freshness factor), hard to do cross-content recomm)
8. Collaborative Filtering (past ⇒ future, other people's preference ⇒ your recomms;  e.g. Amazon's **other customers** who bought this item also purchased ...)
 9. Cold Start Problem (new to a user, no previous ratings data from her; have to rely on Implicit data)
