====== 11.3 AB Testing & Interview ======
Created Wednesday 14 December 2016


**Qingqing Gan**
**A/B Testing**

**Why** do we do A/B testing?
A good way to **prove causality**! 
Normally we know correlation != causality, but in A/B testing, effect must have come from the changes

HiPPO: Highest Paid Person's Opinion
OEC: overall evaluation criteria
False-Positive error is "Type I" error
300 milliseconds are when human eyes can notice the lagging
impression: number of visible elements in a webpage shown on your screen
page view: an instance of an Internet user visiting a particular page on a website

To answer an interview question: 


3 metrics in A/B Testing:
successful metrics (most important)
guardrail metrics (can go up, down, not necessarily lead to bad results, depends on your current goal)

you always need to strick a balance among the metrics


**Factors that affct the false-positive rate (you decided to go with the change, but there is actually no difference between A and B):**
prevalence of real effecits (higher is good)  — prior of alternative hypothesis (domain knowldege)
Power (higher is good) — enough data points
P-value — (lower is good)
//Final Minimum Probability of True Null (False Positive Rate)//
**false-positive rate is like posterior prob of Null Hypothesis, given observed data, it may be large even when P-value < 5% if the prior prob of Null Hypo is high (not all P-values are equally helpful)**

**SRM (Sample Ratio Mismatch)**
Quara question: 
Welch's T-test: statistical tricks you can use when you have unequal sized samples... (discouraged, you need to be very sharp to use it right!)
P29 of 39: main reason you don't want a bad experiment (e.g. SRM), there are still bugs/problems even if you can compensate with statistical tricks!

**Stephen Hsiao:**
**Metrics** 

If the result of you A/B testing is bad, don't just give up, go back and deep dive!!!

Typical Metrics:
customer engagement
monetization
How to adjust the business strategy? Don't Vote! Do A/B Testing!!! 

Three types of metrics:
1. success metrics (your objective goal)
2. guardrail metrics (it tells you lots about your customers, but sometimes too sensitive)
3. Future metrics

Be aware of the concept of Trigger (e.g. ordering dissert in a restaurant)


**Interview:**
process:
Phone Screning (http://collabedit.com)

Basic Skills:
	data savviness (**SQL**, data join, Metrcis)
	general purpose coding (**data structure & algorithm**) 
		— clean data, manipulate a string etc. Python is acceptable: trees/array/queue/stack/linked-list/double-linked list/performance
		— do research on GitHub (python for data structure)
		— if asked which algorithm is better, always ask your constraints (memory, CPU, etc...)
		— Practice coding using https://leetcode.com/ do 50-100 practice problems
	prob/stat
	

in interview: ask how much time do I have for this question? how deep should I go?
always clarify the questions and knwo how you will be evaluated
do you liek quick solution? high-quality solution? many solutions? my best solution only?

Interviewer wants to learn about you:
	1. how do you approach a problem
	2. able to defend your answers?
	3. can communicate well?
	4. be able to pause and check your thought process
	5. demonstrate your sense, strength, weakness (honesty)

when you stuck, talk it though creatively, why you are stuck and ask for help, "am I on the right track?"
"I have seen a similar problem"

Be prepared to answer hard questions:
1. are you sure your answer is right?
2. can you solve the question in a different way?
3. which solution is the best?

Always ask for feedbacks (this might be the only hour in my life talking to you, can you tell me how I can improve?)
"This is a very interesting problem. Sorry I can't solve it now. I am not a quick person. I will go back and send you my answer. Do you mind that?"
provide follow-ups
	"I really enjoyed the conersation with you. May I have your email address?"
	what you taught me
	what I didn't do well but realized now
	"I'd like to hear your feedback"
	
When preparing inerview quesions, practice talking it out loud (just getting the right answer is not enough... talk the thought process out!)
