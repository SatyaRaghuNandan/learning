https://bradzzz.gitbooks.io/ga-seattle-dsi/content/dsi/dsi_10_big_data/2.2-lesson/readme.html (EMR)

Lab:
https://github.com/jasonfeiwang/dsi-sea-week10-2.3


EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): expensive, more robust, more functional
Heroku: easier to use, smaller datasets

S3 (Simple Storage Service): easier to get access to
Google Drive/ Dropbox: slower

Server: A server is a computer or software that performs administration or coordination functions within a network


**EC2:**
Amazon tutorial: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/
Public Key and Private Key: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography

**EC2 setup process:**
create amazon key pairs
create an instance
copy your private key file into [[~/.ssh]]

//Connect to your instance://
chmod 600 Private_Key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/amazon_server_key.pem ec2-user@ec2-35-164-210-140.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
result: 172.31.37.119

Pricing: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/  cost calculator
Spot-Instance: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html
AMI: an image of your instance

**AWS CLI:**
install: pip install awscli
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli
Tutorial: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/backup-to-s3-cli/

set up access credentials:
set up IAM user: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/backup-to-s3-cli/
Admin2 â†’ Adminy
Download the CSV credential file (Right after creating the instance, ONLY AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME!!!)
run "aws configure"

//Check// 
Pricing: 
Security Groups: //aws ec2 describe-security-groups --region us-west-2//
Image: //aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-da2d85ba --region us-west-2//

Launch Spot Instance:
pay attention to security group
	use "launch-wizard-1" OR
	use "default" after adding "SSH" role to it
result: 172.31.9.23

Access Spot Instance
ssh -i [[~/.ssh/]] key_name instance_public_dns

Check you instance request:
aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests --region us-west-2

Kill instances:
//aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-west-2 --output json | grep InstanceId//
//aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-0aa55cd3363b0f187//

**EMR (Amazon Elastic Map Reduce)**
Create Clusters (choose all default settings)
automatically created 3: one slave for EC2, one slave for S3, one for master general usage (check slave/master in security group)

Tutorial: http://docs.aws.amazon.com//ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-gs.html

Enable Web Connection:
	add ssh role for both security groups
	foxyproxy: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-master-node-proxy.html
     
Go to :http://ec2-35-164-58-193.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8888/
Register a User, gs: rant all the permissions, install examples
upload your lab datasets into the **file-manager** section
create an HDFS table using your uploaded csv in Metastore-Manager (may result in errors, but table shows up after refreshing, bug in Hue?)

Hue (Hive User Environment), Spark and MRJOB are all softwares to work based on Hadoop
HIVE is a query language (HiveQL) that queries Hadoop's database, it's NOT SQL!
