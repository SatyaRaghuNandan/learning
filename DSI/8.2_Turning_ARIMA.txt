				work on the lab by following this!

		focus on the **test_stationarity** function
			ts_log_moving_avg_diff.dropna(inplace=True)
			test_stationarity(ts_log_moving_avg_diff)
			p-value is smaller than 0.05,  so it's stationary
		
		Decomposition
			results in a much lowered P-value!

		Forecasting a TS:
			q is the window
			p is how many times the data should repeat?
			d is ?
			
		ACF and PACF plots:
			Autocorrelation - q
			Partial Autocorrelation - p

		results_ARIMA = model.fit(disp = -1)  ?
