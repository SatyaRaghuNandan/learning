"Data Scientist" jobs VARIES a lot!!!

Gate Keeper (1st, HR)

Phone Interview (2nd, hiring manager):
1. confirm you are what's shown on your resume and linkedin
2. do you fit our culture?
3. can you communicate well?

On-site Interview (3 or 4th, technical focused, check whether the team likes you):
1. low-end (analyst) jobs: SQL (a query to solve a real question; high-level knowledge-check like inner vs. outer; not your proficiency on SSIS, SSRS etc.), how would you gather data, how to present to non-tech background clients?
2. high-end (data science) jobs: Python & Your Portfolio, Statistical Anlaysis (Bayesian methodolgy, Regressions, ML vs. AI?, Apply ML to business standards?)
3. less-technical teams (they know they need Data Scientists but not much else.....) tend to ask high-level, vague, cultural questions
4. data architect: Hive, Scala, R
5. data scientist: modeling, viz tools

Technical Interview Tips:
1. They are not looking for correct answers, but your thought process, how to logical digest a complex problem, how to communicate and defend your opinion
2. Don't be afraid to reiterate the questions to interviewers for confirmation (they are curious to hear a different way and not seeing that you didn't hear the question correctly)
3. Be Honest
4. Engage the interviewer in your thought process, allow a two-way conversation, showcase your ability to work collaborately
5. Even you can't solve it completely, show them what you can do and ask for more information/help
6. Educate them that we learned XXX at GA but only for ONE DAY! Don't set your expectation too high!
7. 4 areas they tend to ask:
	a. explain:
	b. defend: your GitHub, Portfolio
	c. changes: solve it in another way? refine this section of code?
	d. impact: what business impact does your solution have?
8. GA Alumni Tips:
	a. organize your Portfolio (GitHub) and make it presentable
	b. actively code and push to GitHub (codeboard: https://codeboard.io/)
	c. organize your job search process with Trello
9. Fei's experience:
	a. Sounds confident, even if you are not sure about the details
	b. Questions to ask
		1. What project are you working on? What tools are you using? How many people are involved?
		2. Can you give me some feedback about my answers?
