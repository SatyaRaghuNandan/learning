====== Hadoop ======
Created Friday 20 January 2017

Hadoop Eco-System:
	Core Hadoop: Store data in HDFS, Process data in MapReduce (Both on cluster of machines, locality principle)
	Tools to easily access data in Hadoop: 
		Hive: SQL-like code, translated into MapReduce code to be executed on the cluster, good at long Batch Processing jobs
		Pig: simple scripting language, translated 
	Impala: query data using SQL, directly from HDFS (no MapReduce), good at Low Latency Queries
	Sqoop: take data from relational db, put into HDFS as delimited files
	HBase: real-time database built on top of HDFS
	Hue, Oozie, Mahout(ML Library), Flume
	
CDH: a distribution of Hadoop, by Cloudera, easy to install
