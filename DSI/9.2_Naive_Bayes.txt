====== 9.2 Naive Bayes ======
Created Tuesday 29 November 2016

Only use Naive Bayes for Classification, not Regression
Mostly used in Text Classification (Spam detection, sentiment analysis, text categorization â€” like LDA  )
Normally NB is compared with Logistic Regression (which also has a likelihood function)
Usually worse performance than Logistic Regression
LogRe can handle correlation between noises, NB can't

But it's an important IDEA and often not that bad

Bag of Words assumption (position doesn't matter)
Conditional Independence (text features are independent from each other) , **THAT's WHY IT IS CALLED NAIVE!!!**

What's the input for Multinomial NB and Bernoulli NB? 
I know Gaussian NB is fed with numerical data matrix
