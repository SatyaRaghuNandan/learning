====== 1.1 Visualization ======
Created Friday 17 February 2017

Visualization Rules
	 Descriptive without Clutter
	 Don't do 3-D Pie-chart, or any 3-D chart
	 Don't use Pie-chart to communicate with technical stakeholders
Visualization Tools:
	 matplotlib is the low-level but powerful standard plotting package for python.
	 seaborn builds on top of matplotlib. It is much easier to use and looks better, but is more
	restricted in functionality.
	 plotly is a fancy plotting library with very nice visuals but very different syntax than matplotlib.

If you have to explain your Viz, it's not a good one!
	Let the graph speak for itself
	Don't put two graphs for the same meaning (people natually tend to compare them)
