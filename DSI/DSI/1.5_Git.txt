====== 1.5 Git ======
Created Friday 17 February 2017

Steps to collaborate on Git Hub
	1. fork from start repo on gihub TO PERSONAL REPO
	2. clone fork onto computer (terminal) in the correct folder. open jupyter notebook..
	3. Modify directly in that same repo forked form
	4. commit -am “blah
	5. push up (from within folder, “dsi-sea-week01-3.4”)
	6. send pull request in github repo 

Steps to combine your work and the remote updates:
	1. git checkout -b temp(create a new branch)
	2. git add .
	3. git commit (store your changes temporarily in the new branch)
	4. git pull origin master (get the latest content from the remote)
		# here you may see "auto-merging failed" conflicts exist, you can't switch back to master until you solve the conflicts
		# check the git status, do another commit if necessary
	5. git checkout master
	6. git merge temp (merge your work into this new pull)
	7. git branch -d temp
		 git stash is another way if you have only a few small changes

Third Way:
	1. git checkout v2 ( create a new "DIFF" file)
	2. git pull origin master (Local files will change)
	3. git merge -s ours master
	4. git checkout master
	5. git merge v2 (Local files will change again)
	6. git push origin master
