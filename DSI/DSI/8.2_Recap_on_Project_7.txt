8.2 Recap on Project 7

Created Saturday 19 November 2016

Workthrough Lab 7-4.3, Apply this to the **Tweet Sentiment Analysis Project**

choose only 4 categories

tf-idf all settings are default
**max_df = 0.1, min_df = 2?**

TruncatedSVD(300)
then normalize the data with pipeline

lsa = make_pipeline(svd, normalizer)
X_lsa = lsa.fit_transform(X)

lsa (latent semantic analysis) and IR term (information retrieval): basically decomposition

do K-Means
true_k is the number of unique labels

max_iter = 100: number of iterations allowed is 100
n_init = 30: try running the algorithm 30 times and then take the average

**homogeneity_score:** 
compare label from the Clustering algorithm and the Original dataset

**completeness_score:**
switch the two sets of labels, otherwise same as homo_score

**v_measure** is the harmonic combination of the above two
**Adjusted Rand-Index**: similarity measure between two clustering labels, like correlation coefficient, 0 is worst, from -1 to 1

You can print out Classification Report and see its relation with these scores

**inverse_transform can get the centroids in the original corodinates**

see the key words with moods with WordCloud
Add some to the Stop Words using Union with "English"

keep the Negative and Positive tweet balanced (3000 vs. 3000, not 1000, vs. 200), otherwise all your keyword features will be Negative ones....
