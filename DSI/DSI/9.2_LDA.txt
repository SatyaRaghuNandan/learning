====== 9.2 LDA ======
Created Tuesday 29 November 2016


Lab:
https://github.com/ga-students/dsi-sea-week08-3.4

LDA is similar to Gaussian Naive Bayes?

LDA does Dimensionality Reduction by looking at X and y! using Eigen Vectors & Bayes
It maximizes the difference between different classes.

Especially good for Multi-Class Classification
Binomial Class Classification: logistic regression is good enough often

Also to use LDA we need to test that Feature Covariance Matrix calculated using data from each class is the same.
