Create Inclusion Indicator for the problematic column, Check its correlation with other columns:
1. missing at completely random, **omit**
2. missing at random, with some patterns
	a. treat inclusion indicator as target variable, use Logistic Regression to predict it with other columns
	b. If a reasonable accuracy score, we say there are good correlations
	c. then predict that column with values from other columns (linear regresion etc.)
	d. **WHY can we do this?**
3. missing not at random (pattern): collect more data or irgnore that column

**Existing Algorithms?**
1. SK_learn has an "Imputer" class in the preprocessing class
	a. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html
2. "multiple imputation algorithm" can be your last resort
3. "orange"
4. Don't trust the "Perfect Imputation Algorithm"


**Resampling:**

1. kiefer notebook is on BootStraping
bootstrapped aggregating = Bagging 

X: input data
n: length of array

with-replacement: elements in the sample subset would have duplicates
without-replacement: no duplicates, but takes LONG time to run

2. Resampling
