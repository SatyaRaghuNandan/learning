Null & Alter hypotheses:
	alternative hypothesis can be 1-sided (p > 0.5) or 2-sided (p !=0.5), if Null Hypothesis is p=0.5
	you may also have Null (p>=0.5) and Alternative (p<0.5)
	most cases alternative hypothesis is 2-sided, sometimes 1-sided is more appropriate

Errors:
	trade-off between Type I and Type II errors, can't reduce both at the sametime
	Type I: significance level, altha
	Type II: beta
	Power: Probability of rejecting the null when it's false (desirable is >= 0.8, but is content-based)
				1 - beta
			
Experimental Design
	P12: reduce Alpha, we get a smaller Power
	
Z-score 

P-value
	Here we are in the Frequentist Paradigm, Not the Bayesian.
	In fact, Bayesian statisticians don't believe in P-value!
	
Others:
	1. One-sided hypotheses are allowed only before seeing data:
		After observing data, it is tempting to turn a two-sided test into a one-sided test. Avoid this temptation. Hypotheses must be set up before observing the data. If they are not, the test should be two-sided.
	2. The significance level selected for a test should reflect the consequences associated with Type 1 and Type 2 Errors
		a. Type I costly → Small Alpha; Type II costly → Large Alpha


**Questions:**
1. find from Lecture 2: "**By the Central Limit Theorem we know that the binomial distribution can be well approximated by a normal distribution if n is large enough."   Answer: **n*p > 5 and n*(1-p) > 5 is an option
2. How to plot P5, with prob = 0.7?
3. **the confidence interval roughly contains all of the values of the proportion that would not have been rejected by the hypothesis test.**
4. P36 revisit!
5. P43 Sample Mean of a Normal Distribution always follow a Normal Distribution sample size 20 is too small. Use t-test we can pick a higher critical value that solves the problem (follow up)
