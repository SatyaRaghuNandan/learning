====== 7 2-15 Regression ======
Created Wednesday 15 February 2017

Reason for more complicated model:
	P4: is the slope in VC larger than that of OJ? 
	
Motivation for Multiple Variable Regression?
	consider multiple factors together
	
Interaction of variables: 
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics)
	

Interactions tend to have higher SE's, since they are difference of differences

When you add in Interaction terms, the SE of all predictor's all increase, since you are asking the model more with the same amount of data...

When your sample size is small, It's an "Under Sampled Experiment", It has low Power....

P42: P-values for blocks are testing whether Block 2 has the same effect as Block 1, Block 3 vs. Block 1, etc....



randomization eliminates confounding â˜º 

it's possible that a variable be both a Effect Modifier and Cofounder, although these are two seperate concepts.


**Lab 7**
2, 3: estimates are same, due to the balaced experiment design, but SE are smaller (not becuase there is block effect considerd though)
10: 7.967 is the effect of N when K is zero (see the first line, End point - Starting Point); -1.633 is the effect of K when N is zero;
14: good example of confounding (after adding the "Age" factor), and their might e other confounders besieds "Age"
22: evidence against Constant Variance assumption; We can use GLM to deal with it

**Homework 7**
For error terms, you can write it out at the end of a formula OR
E(Y) = formula without error
