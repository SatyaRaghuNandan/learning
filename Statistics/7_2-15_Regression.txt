====== 7 2-15 Regression ======
Created Wednesday 15 February 2017

Reason for more complicated model:
	P4: is the slope in VC larger than that of OJ? 
	
Motivation for Multiple Variable Regression?
	consider multiple factors together
	
Interaction of variables: 
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics)
	

Interactions tend to have higher SE's, since they are difference of differences

When you add in Interaction terms, the SE of all predictor's all increase, since you are asking the model more with the same amount of data...

When your sample size is small, It's an "Under Sampled Experiment", It has low Power....

P42: P-values for blocks are testing whether Block 2 has the same effect as Block 1, Block 3 vs. Block 1, etc....


**Observational vs. Experimental Study?**


randomization eliminates confounding â˜º
