====== 1 1-4 Descriptive Statistics ======
Created Wednesday 04 January 2017

Do homework in R markdown file
Do class-exercises in R script is fine
Better to write your own R code so that don't need to remember Package functions ☺

**Note: descriptive statistics are denoted by the word “sample” to distinguish**
**them from the corresponding characteristic of the population. Thus, we say that**
**the sample proportion is an estimate of the proportion of 1s in the population.**
**In this course, we may drop “sample” when it is clear from the context.**

Ways to summarize data:
	categorical var: frequency & relative frequency (table function in R)
	cross-tabulation (categorical or quantitative)
	marginal row/column sums

Ordinal Categorical Var

create Categorical from continuous var: Cut function (cutting data into intervals), breaks
R has an algorithm to determine the best "Break" (interval) when it plots, you can of course change it ☺

Histogram is point-wise constant, PDF is smooth
Putting the histogram and density function on the same scale!! multiply by sample size and bin-width of histogram!
(So the Area Under Curve is Sample-Size * Bin-Width)


Measure the center of a distribution:
usage of Mean?
		estimate the population total
	
	Mean vs. Median?
		median not useful in our example
		
		
	CDF is similar to cumulative relative frequencies
	CDF vs. **Empirical CDF**
	
	
	BoxPlot:
		can't see Bi-Modal or not....
	
	[[BoxPlot]] & Outliers
		IQR: inter-quartile range
		For this purpose an “outlier” is a point that is further than 1.5 X IQR away from the nearest quartile
		
	Strip Plot/Jitter Plot:
		BoxPlot + Dots

Measure of the Spread of a distribution:
	Sample Variance:
		n-1 in the denominator instead of n
		
	Sample Standard Deviation is usually referred as "SD"
	
Bi-Modality:
	you can probably tell the multiple modes from PDF (maybe not Histogram), but PDF is sensitive to the TURNING PARAMETERS, so the result maybe not reliable

Skew:
	Right Skew: mean > median, skewness > 0, **curvature in qq-line?**
	Left Skew: mean < median, skewness < 0, **curvature in qq-line?**
	Is there an R function that calculates it? 
		- Package "Moments"?
	
Tails:
	47, real vs. best normally approximated distribution
	Sample Kurtosis is a measure of this (heavy-tailedness realtvie to the normal distribution)
	P50, 3rd graph, roughly linear but with 2 big outliers....
	**Study the Q-Q plot (Here it's actually Normal Probability Plot **http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/normprpl.htm#importance**)**
		each point represents a data point (each point is by definition a quantile as well ☺ )
		x-axis are multiples of SD
		y-axis are data values
		you are looking for a straight line fitting all points; Don't compare x-axis with y-axis; will come back when teaching regression
		**NPP: **
			**S-shape: tails**
				**last few points above the line & first few points below the line: long/heavy tails**
				**last few points below the line & first few points above the line: short/light tails**
			**all points below the line: right skewed**
			**all points above the line: left skewed**
			
Association between two variables:
	Pearson Correlation Coefficient
	correlation only captures Linear Relationship!

Scatterplot

Scatterplot with smoothing
	P54, The smoother can pick up non-linear relationship as well
	
Line Plot

Spaghetti Plot:
	normally plot without the data point values
	
Transformations:
	z-score (used in Skewness & Kurtosis)
	log transformation (some data are by nature good for this: concentratoin of drugs in urine sample)
		Good example on P58, if not using Log, the distribution is so skewed that is barely legible
	Geometric Mean works better with Log-Trans than arithmetic mean
	
Survival Function:
	e.g.: Kaplan-Meier Estimator
