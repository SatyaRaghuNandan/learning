Fisher's Exact Method
	The Chi-Square test will give you a warning if your sample size is really really small.
	
	The result is random, since it involves random sampling
	
Part II
	All three methods help with misspecified variance situation
	
	P40:
		if this histogram is highly skewed, we would not use the estimated SD * 1.96 to estimate the Confidence Interval, like we did in the slides
		We will use the "Bootstrap Confidence Interval" instead
	
	Jackknife was invented in the 50's; Bootscrap in 60-70's
	
	Jackknife is usually slow, since it spits out 1 value at a time; You can also do a "Random Jackknife", which is faster
	
	vcovHC: variance-covariance matrix & heteroscedasticity consistent
	
	Wald-Statistic is the square of the Z-statistic
	
Lab10
	Since we need to do Linear Regression, specify "Family = Gaussian" or omit that as it's the default in R's GLM
