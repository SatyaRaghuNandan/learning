====== 5 2-1 ANOVA ======
Created Wednesday 01 February 2017

Homework 4:
	second half: use the same simulation dataset but try 2 different ways to handle it. "Blocking" of dataset!
	
ANOVA only works in equal-variance mode
Robust Standard Errors can help to do comparison of multiple means with unequal variances

Two-Sample T-test requirements:
	1. Independecne
	2. Equal variances
	3. Sample sizes must be large or the population distributions must be normal

Problem of multiplicity
	P12, to prove the Type I error is larger than 5%, a bit less than 15% (depends on the correlation of the three tests?)

ANOVA
	a natural extension of the idea of T-test
	P16-17  is not essential to know
	MSB (Mean Squares between), MSW (Mean Squares within)
	Typo on P19 about P = 0.49
	If you want to know the probability of a specific alternative (Null being all are equal), don't use ANOVA, use some other methods
		F-test rejects Null, you know not all are equal â†’ Other specialized tests

	 Assumption of constant variance is more important than Assumption of Normality, don't proceed if the former fails

	**Randomization, Blocking, Experimental Design in Quiz 10?**
	
	Lab 5: 11, 17, why similar? same numerator?
	
			  20: ANOVA assumptions are met if we use the Square Root of the Count variable, but not if using the Count variable directly
				   This is a useful way to handle the Response Variable: **Transformation**
				   But it changes the Hypothesis, See Question 21
				
			Old school: transform the data to meet the Testing Model assumptions
			New approach: find novel models to do the testing without changing the underlying data
			  
Homework 4
	**Q13, the result is close to those in 11 and 12, Since the Sample Sizes are still the same as before ... ?**
	
	Q18: if you use a stringent (small) alpha, you need larger sample sizes
	
	Q20: The Equal Variance approach inflates both the Type I Error and the Power ("false power")
	

**Rationale of F-test?**
**Rationale of Bonferroni correction?**
