====== 9 3-1 GLM ======
Created Wednesday 01 March 2017

MLE can be applied in All kinds of Parametric models (which assumes distribution)
	Non-parametric (models have a variable that's based not on a distribution but maybe a hidden function)

P6:
	Logit Link function was discovered when calculating the MLE:)
	if we use the Possion Regression, the link function will be the log function, that's why we use Log Link function in Possion Regression
	**Try it!**
	
P7:
	the Iterated Weighted Least squares almost always converge for Linear, Poisson, Logistic regressions

10:
	You can still do Least Square Linear Regression when Normality of Errors is not met, But in that case Least Squares is not equivalent to the MLE
	When LS = MLE, we don't need an iterative process to find the best estimators, one matrix operation will do the work (nice)
	
11:
	we are only insteresed in the Difference between two Residual Deviances (which cancel's the first term)

12:
	Fisher Scoring: another name for this Iterated Weighted Least Square algorithm
	
14
	We have a small sample size in this case, so the Contour plot is quite extreme (decreases rapidly away from the maximum)
	Slope-Intercept tradeoff in the Contour plot... **(What's the Slope here?)**
	
15
	Treat the Deviances as the "Residual Sum of Squares"
	
16
	The Null model just has to be smaller than the Full Model (doesn't have to only contain the intercept)
	**GLM and LRT both assumes large sample size!!**

20
	pay attention to the Missing Values!!! The full model may have to use a subset only, but the reduced model can use the full set
	
21
	when change the "Reference Group for Income" from "> $50K" to "< $11K", results changed a lot!
	BUT LRT result remain the same! (Different Parametrization should have no effect)
	Good Practice: choose the Group with the Biggest sample size as the "Reference Group"
	
**When degree of freedom goes up, the Power of your test will be diluted, why?**


27
	Remember that In Linear Regression we have the Sigma-Square, In Logistic Regresssion we don't have that
	
35
	**"Satuarated Model": enough datapoints to estimate the same number of parameters?**
	**In a multiple-variable GLM model, if their P-values are all > 0.05, it doesn't mean they are all non-significant, We need to do further testing; If we parametrize the model in a different way, some may become significant; **
	
41
	Overdispersion almost ALWAYS happen!!
	
45
	Poisson Regression: we assumes the Variance is equal to the Mean, just like in Poisson Distribution
	
46-49
	**Tell GLM what the Disperson Parameter explicitly**, the resulting Z-value dropped dramatically
	always look for dispersion
