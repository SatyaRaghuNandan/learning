====== 8 2-22 GLM ======
Created Wednesday 22 February 2017

GLM:
	Linear Model but with relaxed requirements, more flexible

Our first linear model is really bad (all three assumptions are violated)
	But it can probably be cured by using "Robust SE", which don't assume on a specific formula of the errors?
	
Poisson Regression is often used in "Count Data" problems, like the Housing problem in the slide; 
	it can also be used to model continous response variables (like concentration of some chemicals)

GLM's don't use T-Distribution, They are based on Normal Distribution

"Deviance Residuals"

"Fisher Scoring iterations": steps before the result converges

Poisson Regression assumptions (need to be checked of course):
	**Variance proportional to mean!**
	conditional independence of observations given covariate
	Large sample sizes

P19
	I(SQFT/1000) is called an "I-variable", so that you don't need to define a new variable in the dataframe
	
P21
	negative interaction between SOFT/1000 and LOT_SIZE/1000
	be aware that some Condo's 

P23
	A Link function is normally monotone and differentiable
	The Variance function is also usually monotone
	
P28
	if you don't specify "Family" in GLM, the default is Linear Regression
	we sometimes "Mix-and-Match" among these 3 most common regressions's link & variance functions
	
P32
	why family = "Binomial"?
		**Because the Logistic Regression is used to predict "Proportion"?**

P37
	Odd of failure != Probability of failure
	
P38
	except for Least Squares, most of the algorithms need iteration and are not guaranteed to Converge!
	

We don't use T-test in GLM a lot, that's only for Linear Model, Small Sample Size, Normally distributed errors
**All others we use the Z-statistic from the Normal Distribution, and thus requires Large Sample Sizes. How large is large enough?**

P45
	Pearson residuals should have constant variance by defition
	


Lab8
	Q1-6: Not a Poisson Regression, instead it's Log(y), not Log(mu).  It's mean of the Log, not the Log of the Mean
	Notice the results of this "Log-Transformed" Linear Regression is DIFFERENT from that of the Poisson Regression
