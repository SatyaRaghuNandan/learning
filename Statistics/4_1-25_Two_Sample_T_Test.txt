====== 4 1-25 Two Sample T Test ======
Created Friday 03 February 2017

P7 **Why? Even when X_Bar is always normally distributed?**
Even if the population distribution is normal, the distribution of Z might
not be normal because s is not close enough to σ. 

P17
If n is small **and the population distribution is normal**, then use the t n−1
distribution.
If n is small and we are not sure if the population distribution is normal then we
are stuck for now! (see Exact methods later in course)

P35
Reason 2, why?


**What's the theoretical basis for T-test?**

**Comparison of Two Population Means with Independent Samples**

Z-statistic


If n A and n B are both large, use the standard normal distribution, (e.g., 1.96) for
α = 0.05.
If n is small and the population distributions are both normal, then use the
t n A +n B −2 distribution.
If n is small and we are not sure if the population distribution is normal then we
are stuck for now! (see Exact methods later in course)

R uses the “Welch” adjustment to the degrees of freedom

	unequal variance: when sample sizes are large
	equal variance: when sample sizes are small and there is theoretical justification for equal variance
		Pooled Sample Variance



**Comparison of Two Population Proportions with Independent Samples**

**Only use this test when sample sizes are large**
**Why must we use the Normal Z test, instead of T test?**
	For comparison of proportions with small sample sizes there is an “exact” test,
Null Hypothesis: Same Proportion, phat ("Pooled" estimate) → Same variance
