For future iterations:
1. There were thoughts about providing a way for users to contact representatives. 
2. A big one was comparing traffic volume of intersections to collision rates when rating safety. For example, if an intersection has 2x more accidents than average but also 2x the traffic volume - does that mean it's actually average in regards to safety? 
3. There were also suggestions to incorporate a lot of the other data sets (pedestrian injuries, pedestrian fatalities, bike accidents, bike fatalities) so as to not just rate vehicle to vehicle collisions.
4. functionality to put in street address & pinpoint, put in details with in the marker
5. I'd love to see a time dimension added - most dangerous intersections that last N days, as well as most dangerous intersections during the morning commute, evening commute, etc... (Matt Danielson)
