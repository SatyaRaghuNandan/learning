Introduction
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
Advantages of Spark:
	Analysts can experiment with their data much more quickly (data preprocessing & iteration)
		Pass all intermediate results into pipeline, no need to write them out
		rich set of transformations
		in-memory processing
	Better at being an operating system than most exploratory systems
	
Limitations of Spark:
	batch processsing: not as good as Hadoop
	SQL functionality: not as good as Hive
	Statistics: nowhere close to R
	Stream processing, ML, graph processing: on-going development
