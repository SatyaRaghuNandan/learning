Event types:
	loading, scripting, rendering, painting

Critical Rendering Path
	DOM → CSSOM → Render Tree → Layout → Paint

DOM:
	Browser receives HTML file, process it, build the DOM (Document Object Model)
		processing: HTML characters → Tokens → Nodes → DOM (DOM is a Tree of Nodes, also containing Nodes' properties) 
	DOM captures the content of the page
	we can use Partial DOM tree to make the page load faster (Incremental HTML Delivery)
	

CSSOM:
	Browser receives CSS, process it, build CSSOM
		processing: characters → tokens → nodes → CSSOM 
		cascading style sheet (child node inherits its parent's style), cascading rules
	CSSOM captures the style of the page
	We can't use a partial CSSOM tree ("CSS is render blocking!")
	== The browser blocks page rendering until we received and processed all of the CSS!
	It also blocking executing of [[JavaScirpt]] engine, and thus constructing the DOM

Render Tree
	It only captures visible contents
	combining both DOM and CSSOM
	
Layout
	determins the location and size of the Render Tree elements
	everytime you update the Render Tree, you might need to rerun the layout file
	rule of thumb: do batch updates, avoid multiple layout events
	
Painting
	everytime you update the Render Tree, you might need to redo the painting work
		

Entire Process:
	send HTML request, receive response header and data
	parse HTML, request CSS files, parse CSS files, construct CSSOM, DOM
	compute the Render Tree ("Recalculate Style" event)
	Paint event
