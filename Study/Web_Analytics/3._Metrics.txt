====== 3. Metrics ======
Created Sunday 23 July 2017

Misc:
Ajax, Flash, Video-driven sites → page views metric becomes useless?
Check the relationship between Discover Page loading time & Bounce Rate?


**Metrics:**
	General Rule:
	1. If you must overlay your own opinoins and interpretations to understand the metric, it's a bad metric!
	2. What are great metrics?
				uncomplex, relevant, timely, instantly useful
	3. Lessons:
		a. Perfection Is... the Enemy of Good Enough (If 90% confidence in the data, then make a decision)
		b. Critical Few, Baby, Critical Few! (key metrics)
		c. Web Metrics Lifecycle Process Is Your Friend! (Define -> Measure -> Analyze -> Action -> Improve or Eliminate)
	4. Key strategies:
		a. Diagnosing Root Cause of a Metric's Performance ( brainstorm with PM's -> cost-benefit analysis for each factor -> make action)
		b. Leverageing Custom Reporting (within mature Web Analytics tools)
		c. Starting with Macro Insights (don't dive into specific metrics quickly...) by asking:
			1. How many Visitors are comming to my website?
			2. where are Visitors comining from? (referring URLs and Search (non-branded) Keywords  https://www.google.com/webmasters/f)
			3. What do I want visitors do? 
			4. What did visitors realy do?
				a. Top entry pages (don't obssess with the Home Page anymore!)
				b. Top viewed pages
				c. Site overlay (click density) analysis
				d. Abandonment analysis
	
	Time on Page & Time on Site: 
		no easy way to know when the visitor left a page/site
	
	Bounce Rate:
		at least 2 levels: aggregated entired site level, top landing pages (Top Entry Pages report)
		mesaure BR for your website's top referrers
		measure BR for your search keywords
		For blog, measure the BR only for New Visitors (you want them to subscribe to your RSS feed, readh your About page etc.)
		
	Exit Rate:
		where do people exit after they start their session?
			% of people who entered anywhere on the site but exited from a particular page
			How to tell "good/neutral exits" from "bad exits"? — Bounce Rate of that page
	
	Abandonment Rate:
		when user exit a "structured experience" (e.g. signing up for an email, completing a closed mulitpage process etc.)
		
	Conversion Rate:
		Outcomes / (Unique Visitors or Visits): depends on your business goal but ususally "Unique Visitors" is better
		
	Engagement:
		It's qualitative at its core; But Web Analytics (quantitative data) can only measure the Degree of Engagement, not the Kind.
			visit IBM websites many times due to bad search result or looking for their new products
		Even with high engagement metric, ask "What's the outcome for the business"
		Ways to get "kind of engagement":
			inline/on-exit surverys, likilihood to recommend, primary market research, customer retention over time
